# 🤔 What is this?

capNcook is a Python Flask-based web application designed for dark web exploration. 

![capNcook](static/images/pictures_for_readme/main.png)

> "What about anonymity?"

That's the point. You don't need to worry about it now, our tool utilizes tor for anonymity and privacy, identifies entry and exit nodes while esthablishing a tor circuit, 
rebuild the tor circuit each time you run the tool and flush old circuits. 

The tool employs efficient multi-threading in Python to enhance performance 🚀 

Live implementation of different tools and techniques to explore and do basic recon on hidden services over TOR

## 📊 capNcook : First of its kind

# 🔭 Usage Guidelines

| Name | ⚡ What does it do? ⚡|
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|🔍 **Search Page** | Enter keyword, Select search engine, index onion domains.|
|🧅 **Onion Check** | Click on `Run Onion Check` button to check the status of onion domains, including response codes, titles, and descriptions.|
|🕵️ **Recon** | Click on `Run Recon` button to perform WHOIS lookups on onion domains.|
|🗡 **Headers** | Click on `Run Headers` button to capture response headers and screenshots of onion domains.|
|🪐 **Enumeration** | Click on `Run Dir Fuzz` button to run FeroxBuster against onion domains to find sub-directories/files.|

# Screenshots

- This is the main interface of tool, select your preferred search engine and you can search using keywords like you'd do over any normal search engine and it'll list domains related to the keyword.

![main](static/images/pictures_for_readme/main.png)

- In `onion_check`, it'll grab the site's title and description, its status code, and based on the status code it'll filter it as active / inactive.

- In recon, it's doing recon using `torwhois` database to pull info regarding each listed onion domain if available.

- In headers, it's taking screenshots and grabbing server response headers, often reveals the technology or programming language used to build the web application via header like `X-Powered-By`, It may include information about the underlying frameworks or CMS (Content Management System) being used. The `Server` header typically indicates the software and version running on the server.
